# Cotton Plant Disease Prediction
<h4> Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/janmejaybhoi/cotton-disease-dataset <br/> <br/>
A Deep Learning project to classify an image into four classes and find out whether the image belongs to a diseased or fresh cotton plant/leaves using the InceptionResNetV2 transfer learning technique in Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with an accuracy of more than 98% on training and test dataset. </h4>
<h4> Technologies Used: </h4>
<p>
  1. Transfer learning technique - InceptionResNetV2 in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) <br/>
  2. Data Augmentation to generate more data (image) from the training dataset <br/>
  3. Flask Framework
